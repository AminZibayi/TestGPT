1. "migration.py": This script will contain the main migration logic. Shared dependencies might include:
   - Forestry and Tina CMS APIs or SDKs for data extraction and insertion.
   - JSON parsing libraries to handle the data from the .json files.

2. "posts.json", "pages.json", "settings.json" in both "forestry_data" and "tinaCMS_data" directories: These files will contain the data to be migrated. Shared dependencies might include:
   - Common data schemas for posts, pages, and settings. These schemas will define the structure of the data in both Forestry and Tina CMS.
   - Shared id names for posts, pages, and settings. These ids will be used to map the data from Forestry to Tina CMS.

3. "migration_tests.py": This script will contain the tests for the migration. Shared dependencies might include:
   - The same Forestry and Tina CMS APIs or SDKs as "migration.py" to create test data and verify the migration.
   - The same JSON parsing libraries as "migration.py" to handle the test data.
   - Test framework dependencies, such as pytest or unittest in Python.

4. Message names: These might include error or success messages that are used in both "migration.py" and "migration_tests.py" to indicate the status of the migration.

5. Function names: These might include function names that are used in both "migration.py" and "migration_tests.py". For example, a function to extract data from Forestry might be called "extract_forestry_data", and a function to insert data into Tina CMS might be called "insert_tina_data". These functions would be used in both the migration and the tests.
