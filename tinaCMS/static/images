The "./tinaCMS/static/images" directory is not a code file but a directory for storing static image files. Therefore, it doesn't contain any code to generate. However, in the context of migration, we can provide a Python snippet that copies all images from the Forestry CMS to the Tina CMS. Here's how it can be done using Python's shutil module:

```python
import shutil
import os

source_dir = './forestryCMS/static/images'
target_dir = './tinaCMS/static/images'

file_names = os.listdir(source_dir)

for file_name in file_names:
    shutil.copy(os.path.join(source_dir, file_name), target_dir)
```

This script will copy all the images from the Forestry CMS to the Tina CMS.
