Since the "./tinaCMS/content/pages" directory is meant to contain markdown files migrated from the Forestry CMS, the actual code generation would be done in the migration script. However, an example of a markdown file that might be generated in this directory could look like this:

---
title: 'Page Title'
date: '2021-12-01'
author: 'Author Name'
tags: ['tag1', 'tag2']
---

This is the content of the page.
