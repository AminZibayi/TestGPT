Since "./forestryCMS/content/posts" is a directory containing markdown files, there's no specific code to generate for it. However, if you want to create a sample markdown file within this directory, here's how it might look:

---
title: "Sample Post"
date: 2021-12-01
author: "Author Name"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---

This is a sample post in Forestry CMS. The content of the post goes here.
