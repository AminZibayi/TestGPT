Since the file "./forestryCMS/content/pages" is a directory containing markdown files, we can't generate code for it. However, we can provide an example of how a markdown file in this directory might look like:

---
title: "Page Title"
date: 2021-12-01
author: "Author Name"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---

# Page Title

This is the content of the page.
